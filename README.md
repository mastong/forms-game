# shapes-game

The main objective of this project is to test 2 new technologies (at least for me), **Angular2 and SVG**. The project itself is more a pretext than anything else.

## The game
In a "game board", several geometric shapes are moving, bouncing off the "walls".  
The player must click the shapes, which will then be divided in 2 smaller shapes.  
When a shape has reached its minimal size and is clicked, it's remove from the game board.  
The objective is to clear the board in a minimum amount of time.  
Each level has more shapes than the previous, and also a little more time to clear it.  

## Technical criteria
It must be as light as possible.  
It must work on all the modern browsers.
It must work on mobile devices.

## TODO
Test on a mobile device  
CSS tuning to make the whole thing more "sexy"  
Find a way to make the click on shapes more "easy". Currently it's frustating...
