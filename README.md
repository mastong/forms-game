# shapes-game

The main objective of this project is to test 2 new technologies (at least for me), **Angular2 and SVG**. The project itself is more a pretext than anyting else.

## The game
In a "game board", several geometric shapes are moving, bouncing off the "walls".  
The player must click the shapes, which will then be divided in 2 smaller shapes.  
When a shape has reached its minimal size and is clicked, it's remove from the game board.  
The objective is to clear the board in a minimum amount of time.

*The project is currently a "work in progress", and it's nowhere near this state. It's more a POC for now...*

## Technical criteria
It must be as light as possible.  
It must work on all the modern browsers.
It must work on mobile devices.
