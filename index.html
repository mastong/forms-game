<p>The main objective of this project is to test 2 new technologies (at least for me), <strong>Angular2 and SVG</strong>. The project itself is more a pretext than anything else.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-game" class="anchor" href="#the-game" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The game</h2>

<p>In a "game board", several geometric shapes are moving, bouncing off the "walls".<br>
The player must click the shapes, which will then be divided in 2 smaller shapes.<br>
When a shape has reached its minimal size and is clicked, it's remove from the game board.<br>
The objective is to clear the board in a minimum amount of time.</p>

<p><em>The project is currently a "work in progress", and it's nowhere near this state. It's more a POC for now...</em></p>

<h2>
<a id="technical-criteria" class="anchor" href="#technical-criteria" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical criteria</h2>

<p>It must be as light as possible.<br>
It must work on all the modern browsers.
It must work on mobile devices.</p>
